My name is Erica, I am a current student in the Masters of Environmental Data Science program. I am passionate to visualize ecosystem dynamics through computational modeling and apply data skills to global conservation issues. I aim to work with nonprofits and government entities to utilize data science for science communication and decision making on global issues such as conservation and environmental justice.
